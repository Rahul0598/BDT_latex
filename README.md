## BDT_latex

BDT_latex.py is a program that automates the _Belcher Diagnostic Test_ for _LaTeX_ documents. The _Belcher Diagnostic Test_ was invented to improve academic writing by Wendy Laura Belcher in her book [_Writing Your Journal Article in Twelve Weeks: A Guide to Academic Publishing Success_ ](http://wendybelcher.com/writing-advice/writing-your-journal-article-in-twelve) and is copyrighted by her. The program is designed to implement the test on projects that use multiple files, such as _TeX_ files or images. Instructions on using the test to improve writing are in Belcherâ€™s book.


## Usage

`python BDT_latex.py examples.tex`

The script creates new TeX files with suffix `_BDT`  (e.g.,  `examples_BDT.tex`) in the same directory of the original file. The new files can be compiled with LaTeX to proceed with the Belched Diagnostic Test.


## Documentation

The full documentation of the code is available at [here](https://github.com/carlobar/BDT_latex/blob/master/documentation).


## Requirements

The code can be executed with Python 2.7 or later. The program requires the LaTeX package `xcolor`.
