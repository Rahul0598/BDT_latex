\begin{description}
 \item[Before:] A second attack might be more difficult to launch because of scarce resources, which are particularly limited for unlawful activities. 
 
 \item[After:] A second attack might be more difficult to launch, because unlawful activities count with scarce resources.
 
 \item[Better:] Unlawful activities have limited resources, making it difficult to launch a second attack.

\begin{description}
 \item[Before:] The transmission company would try to find the smallest number of companies $n$ to prevent the profitability of launching attacks and to minimize expenses.
  
 \item[After:] The transmission company would choose $n$ companies to make attacks unprofitable with minimum expenses.

\begin{description}
 \item[Before:] Towers were not totally demolished, just partially destroyed to allow for easier repairs.
 
 \item[After:] Towers were partially damaged to allow both cheap and fast repairs.
 
 \item[Better:] Attackers partially damaged towers to allow both cheap and fast repairs.
